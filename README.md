## Welcome to Greg.Fun!

I don't know what I'm going to do with this site yet.  Probably post pictures, gifs, and jokes that have all made me laugh out loud.  But that's just the first idea.

### Markdown is pretty cool

Here's some basic information in case you want to use it to create an issue, submit a PR, etc.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
